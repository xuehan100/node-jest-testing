# How to run tests with jest

I suggest to install `yarn ` and install and run `jest` using `yarn` or `jest` CLI rather than `npm` -- see jest getting-started documentation

If you are using `yarn`:    

`yarn test` runs all tests    

Or if you have installed `jest` CLI:   

`jest test-file` runs test matching the pattern `tests-file`    

To run coverage analysis:    

`jest --coverage` runs all tests and produce coverage reports in the `coverage` directory    

To view coverage reports:   

Open `coverage/lcov-report/index.html` in your browser
